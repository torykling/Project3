# UI Element
## **Goal**
>The goal of this project was to create a site with a user interface accordion pattern that brings in data from a news API.

## **Languages**
>HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## **Download**
>To download this project, fork and clone the repository. Open in your browser to read the latest news for today!

## **Challenges**
>This API had some array items with missing data. I had to build a for loop to prevent a title from displaying if its description was an empty string and to prevent the author from displaying if its author was null. 

## **Next Steps**
>I'd like to add a search function that would allow the user to search for top stories by category.
